## LexiAtlas roadmap (notes, not part of the site)

This file tracks **possible future improvements** and ideas that are either out-of-scope for current iterations, require more expertise/curation, or need a clear moderation plan.

### Short-term candidates (low/medium lift)
- **Resource tags (Format/Access)**: Add lightweight, standardized badges per resource link (e.g., PDF/Web/Video, Open/Paywalled, Archived). Start objective-only; avoid “Difficulty” until guidelines exist.
- **More metadata coverage**: Refine `family/branch/region/period/geo` where uncertain; add `typing` blocks to additional scripts as needed.
- **“Related languages” tuning**: Allow manual overrides (e.g., cross-family contact, script-based grouping) in frontmatter when simple family/branch isn’t ideal.

### Deferred / research-heavy ideas
- **Cross-language dictionary comparison**: A “compare this word across Germanic/Semitic/etc.” tool needs a structured registry of lexica with query URL patterns or API sources, plus normalization across scripts/transliterations.
- **Difficulty ratings for resources**: Needs contributor guidelines and ongoing review; likely subjective and can drift without maintenance.
- **Embedded comments / community notes**: Consider Giscus or GitHub Discussions integration only with a moderation plan (spam/abuse) and clear scope (per-language “best grammar”, beginner tips).
- **True offline mode**: Beyond “download markdown” and “print to PDF”, a full offline web app would require service workers, caching strategy, and more UI surface area.

### Nice-to-have UX enhancements
- **Keyboard/input utilities**: richer palettes, transliteration helpers, and/or links curated per OS (macOS/Windows/Linux).
- **Geo/timeline accuracy**: curated ranges per language stage (e.g., Old/Middle/Late Egyptian; Classical/Koine/Byzantine Greek), possibly as separate pages when resources warrant.
