# Content notice (links, third‑party works, provenance)

LexiAtlas is a community-maintained directory of links to third‑party learning resources (books, PDFs, sites, videos, corpora, etc.).

## Third‑party rights

- Resource links point to third‑party materials that are governed by their own rights and terms.
- LexiAtlas does not claim ownership of third‑party works.

## Provenance

- The initial directory structure and many links were reconstructed from an archival snapshot of the original Lexicity site (see `/credits/`).
- Over time, entries are curated, updated, and reorganized by the community.

## Takedown / corrections

If you are the original creator, represent the rights holder, or believe any material should be removed or corrected, contact:

Please include the page URL(s) and the requested change.
