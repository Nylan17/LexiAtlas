      <p>
        This is a community-maintained directory of learning resources for ancient and historical languages,
        inspired by an older passion project that went offline.
        We started from an archival snapshot, then we curate and update links over time.
      </p>
      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Each language has its own page.</li>
        <li>Content lives in version-controlled Markdown (easy to review and improve).</li>
        <li>Search is static (no server), and the site is deployed as static files.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Contributing</h2>
      <p>
        If you find better current URLs for resources (or dead links), use <a href="/contribute/">Contribute</a>.
        For attribution and takedown notes, see <a href="/usage/">Usage</a>.
