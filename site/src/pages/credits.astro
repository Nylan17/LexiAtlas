        This project is inspired by an older, community-loved resource. We aim to give clear credit
        to the original creator and to archival sources used to restore the starting point, while evolving this into
        an actively maintained, community-updated directory.
      </p>
      <h2>Original Lexicity</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Original creator</strong>: (to be filled in once verified)</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Status</strong>: the original site appears to be offline; the creator has been incommunicado for some time.
          This revival is intended as preservation + continued community maintenance, not a replacement.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Archival sources</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Wayback Machine</strong>: initial snapshot content was reconstructed from archived pages.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>This revival</h2>
